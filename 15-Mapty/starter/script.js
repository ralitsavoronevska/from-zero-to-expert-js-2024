// Using the Geolocation API

// The Geolocation API is called an API, because it is in fact a browser API, just like, for example,
// internalization, or timers, or really anything, that a browser gives us. And so, Geolocation is
// just another API like that, but it's also a very modern one. And actually, there are many other
// modern APIs like that. For example, to access the user's camera or even to make user's phone vibrant.
// So, there is all kinds of crazy stuff that you can do, but in this Project let's simply focus on Geolocation.

// Displaying a Map Using Leaflet Library
// In this video we are going to learn how to display a Map using a 3rd Party Library called "Leaflet".

// Displaying a Map Marker
// So, nin this video we are going to display a Map Marker wherever we click on the Map.
// And for that we are going to use, one more time, the Leaflet Library.

// Rendering Workout Input Form
// So, let's now render the Workout Input Form whenever the user clicks on the Map.

// Project Architecture
// So, before we continue any further in our Project, we should now think a little bit about our Project Architecture.

// So, to start, one of the most important aspects of any Architecture is to decide "Where" and "How" to store the Data.
// Because the Data is probably the most fundamental part of any Application. Because without Data is doen't even make sense
// to have an Application in the first place. What will the Application be about if NOT about some sort of Data?

// Now, in this case the Data that we need to store and to manage comes directly from the User Stories.
// And so, we will design our Classes so that they can create Objects that will hold thiis kind of Data.
// And I believe that this is the best way of designing the Classes to really fit our User Stories.

// And so, with this structure here, we have everything that is related to building the Application itself,
// organized into 1 block of Data and Functionality. And actually, having a Class that contains all the
// Data and Methods about the Application, like we have here, is a pretty common thihng that you will see in
// simple JS Applications like this one. Now, if the Application was a bit more complex, then we could divide this
// Architecture even further and create 1 Class that will only be concerned with the User Interface and 1 Class
// for the so called "Business Logic". So, basically, the Logic that works only with the underlying Data.

// But in this case we can just keep it simple like this. And so, as I mentioned before, this Architecture will
// then allows us to have everything that is about the Application in 1 nice selfcontained block.
// And, besided the Application itself, we then also have these Classes that are only conserted about the Data.
// And so, therefore, Application and Data will be nicely separated in a very logical way I believe.
// Now, what's also great about this is that we will be able to protect all of these Methods so that they are nicely
// encapsulated and NOT accesible from everywhere else in the code.

// Refactoring for Project Architecture
// Let's now implement the Architecture that we just discussed in the previous lecture.

// Managing Workout Data: Creating Classes
// So, in this video we are going to implement Classes to mkanage the Data about our Cycling and Running Workouts
// that are coming from the User Interface.

// Creating a new Workout
// So, using the Workout Classes that we just implemented, let's now finally implement the feature of creating a new Workout
// from our Interface.

// Rendering Workouts
// So, let's now render new workouts in the Sidebar of our User Interface.
// And so, what I mean with rendering is to basically create a list item like this for each Workout.

// Move to Marker on Click
// In this lecture, we are going to implement a feature that will basically move the Map to the position of the Workout
// that wa clikced on the Sidebar.

// Working with localStorage
// Let's now use the localStorage API in order to make the Workout Data persist across multiple page reloads.

// So, basically the idea is that whenever a new Workout is added, then all of the Workouts will be added to localStorage.
// And so, localStorage is basically a place in the browser where we ca store Data that will stay there even after we close the page.
// So, basically the Data is basically linked to the URL on which we are using the Application.
// So, whenever there is a new Workout, we will take the entire Workouts Array and store it in the localStorage.
// And then, whenever the page loads, we will load all the Workouts from the localStorage and render them on the Map
// and also on the List. So, just like we do it when the User submits a new Workout. And so like this, when you relaod the page,
// it will then apperat as if all the Workouts you had previously are still in the same place.
